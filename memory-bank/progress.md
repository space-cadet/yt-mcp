# Progress: YouTube MCP Server

## What Works

The YouTube MCP Server has successfully implemented the following functionality:

1. **Core MCP Server**
   - ✅ Fully functional MCP server implementation
   - ✅ Standard I/O transport layer
   - ✅ Tool registration and execution
   - ✅ Parameter validation with Zod schemas
   - ✅ Example prompts via prompts/list method
   - ✅ Multiple startup methods for reliable Claude integration

2. **Video Information Tools**
   - ✅ `getVideoDetails`: Retrieves comprehensive video information
   - ✅ `searchVideos`: Searches for videos based on query string
   - ✅ `getRelatedVideos`: Finds videos related to a specific video
   - ✅ `getVideoEngagementRatio`: Calculates engagement metrics

3. **Transcript Management**
   - ✅ `getTranscripts`: Retrieves captions for videos
   - ✅ Support for language selection
   - ✅ Handling of time-stamped captions

4. **Channel Analysis**
   - ✅ `getChannelStatistics`: Retrieves channel metrics
   - ✅ `getChannelTopVideos`: Gets most-viewed videos from a channel

5. **Playlist Management**
   - ✅ `getPlaylistDetails`: Retrieves comprehensive playlist information
   - ✅ `getPlaylistVideos`: Gets all videos within a playlist
   - ✅ `searchPublicPlaylists`: Searches for playlists by keywords
   - ✅ `getChannelPlaylists`: Retrieves playlists from a specific channel
   - ✅ `getMyPlaylists`: Retrieves user's own playlists (including private ones)

6. **Authentication**
   - ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
   - ✅ Token management (storage, refresh, revocation)
   - ✅ `checkOAuthStatus`: Verifies authentication status
   - ✅ CLI tools for authentication management

7. **Trend Analysis**
   - ✅ `getTrendingVideos`: Retrieves trending videos by region and category
   - ✅ `compareVideos`: Compares statistics across multiple videos

8. **Infrastructure**
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation
   - ✅ npm package publication
   - ✅ Environment variable configuration
   - ✅ Documentation in README

## What's Left to Build

While the core functionality is complete, there are several areas for potential enhancement:

1. **Additional Tools**
   - ⬜ Comment retrieval and analysis
   - ✅ Playlist management
   - ✅ Authentication and private data access
   - ⬜ Historical trend analysis
   - ⬜ Tag analysis and categorization
   - ⬜ Playlist creation and management (write operations)

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ⬜ Response caching layer
   - ⬜ Parallel request handling
   - ⬜ Optimized pagination for large datasets

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - ⬜ More detailed error messages
   - ⬜ Retry mechanism for transient failures
   - ⬜ Fallback strategies for partial data

4. **Testing**
   - ⬜ Comprehensive unit tests
   - ⬜ Integration tests with YouTube API
   - ⬜ Performance benchmarks

5. **Documentation**
   - ⬜ Additional usage examples
   - ⬜ Advanced configuration options
   - ⬜ Tutorial for common use cases

## Current Status

The project is in a **stable, functional state** with all core requirements implemented. The server correctly implements the MCP specification and provides reliable access to YouTube data.

The codebase is well-structured, following good software engineering practices:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Consistent error handling
- Modular architecture

The package is published on npm and can be installed and used as described in the README.

## Known Issues

While there are no critical issues, there are some limitations to be aware of:

1. **YouTube API Quota**: The server depends on the YouTube API, which has daily quota limits. Heavy usage may exceed these limits.

2. **Transcript Availability**: Not all YouTube videos have transcripts/captions available, which may lead to transcript retrieval failures.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Rapid successive requests may trigger YouTube API rate limiting.

4. **Large Result Sets**: Very large result sets (hundreds or thousands of items) may require multiple API calls and pagination handling.

5. **Language Support**: Transcript retrieval has limitations based on available caption tracks for videos.

6. **Type Declarations**: The TypeScript type declarations for YouTube API responses were updated to properly handle GaxiosResponse types. This required adding the gaxios package as a dependency.

7. **MCP Server Integration**: When using with Claude, the server must be started directly using Node.js rather than through pnpm to avoid JSON-RPC communication interference. The provided wrapper scripts and alternative startup methods address this issue.

8. **OAuth Requirements**: OAuth authentication requires Google Cloud Console configuration and agreement to Google's API Services User Data Policy, which may require a privacy policy for applications that become public.

9. **OAuth Port Configuration**: The OAuth callback server needs to run on a port that matches what's configured in Google Cloud Console. Multiple authorized redirect URIs can be registered to support different ports.

These issues are inherent to the YouTube API rather than problems with the implementation, but they should be considered when using the server.

This progress summary reflects the current state of the YouTube MCP Server project, highlighting both completed work and opportunities for future enhancement.
