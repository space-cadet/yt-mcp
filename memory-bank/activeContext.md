# Active Context: YouTube MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The YouTube MCP Server is currently a functional implementation that provides access to YouTube data through a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface. The core functionality is complete, with all primary tools implemented and operational.

The current focus is on:

1. **Code Security Review**: We have completed a security review of the codebase to ensure there are no vulnerabilities or malicious code. The review confirmed the codebase is secure and follows best practices for handling API keys and external requests.

2. **Documentation**: Setting up comprehensive documentation in the memory-bank to establish a clear understanding of the project structure, technologies, and implementation patterns.

3. **Potential Enhancements**: Identifying opportunities for improving the current implementation with additional features, better error handling, or performance optimizations.

## Recent Changes

The most significant recent change is the initialization of the memory-bank directory with core documentation files:

1. Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project scope and requirements
2. Created `productContext.md` to outline the problems solved and user experience goals
3. Created `systemPatterns.md` to document the architecture and design patterns
4. Created `techContext.md` to detail the technology stack and dependencies
5. Created this `activeContext.md` file to track current status and next steps

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps for the project include:

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**: Finish creating the remaining required documentation files, including `progress.md`.

2. **Code Refinements**: Identify potential areas for code improvement, such as:
   - Enhanced error handling with more detailed error messages
   - Additional validation for edge cases
   - Performance optimizations for handling large result sets

3. **Testing Expansion**: Develop a more comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability across different scenarios.

4. **Documentation Enhancements**: Improve inline code documentation with detailed JSDoc comments.

5. **Feature Exploration**: Consider additional YouTube API capabilities that could be exposed through new MCP tools.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Key decisions currently under consideration:

1. **Caching Strategy**: Whether to implement a caching layer to reduce YouTube API quota usage and improve response times.

2. **Configuration Options**: Expanding the available configuration options to provide more flexibility in how the server operates.

3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhancing error responses with more context and potential recovery strategies.

4. **Tool Expansion**: Identifying additional YouTube API endpoints that would be valuable to expose as MCP tools.

5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring the server operates correctly across different operating systems and Node.js versions.

The project is currently in a stable state with all core functionality implemented. The focus is now on refinement, documentation, and potential feature expansion.
