# Active Context: YouTube MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The YouTube MCP Server is currently a functional implementation that provides access to YouTube data through a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface. The core functionality is complete, with all primary tools implemented and operational.

The current focus is on:

1. **OAuth Implementation**: We have implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication to access private YouTube playlists and content. This major enhancement enables users to authenticate with their Google account and access their personal YouTube data.

2. **Documentation**: Updating comprehensive documentation in the memory-bank to reflect the new OAuth capabilities and provide guidance on setup and usage.

3. **Security and Privacy**: Ensuring OAuth implementation follows best practices for security and user privacy, including providing a privacy policy template.

4. **Potential Enhancements**: Identifying opportunities for improving the current implementation with additional features, better error handling, or performance optimizations.

## Recent Changes

The most significant recent changes include:

1. **OAuth Authentication Implementation**: Added full OAuth 2.0 support:
   - Created OAuth utility modules for token management and refresh
   - Implemented OAuth server for handling authentication callbacks
   - Added CLI for user-friendly authentication flow
   - Added new MCP tools for OAuth status and private playlists access
   - Updated existing playlist tools to support authenticated requests
   - Added port configuration flexibility via environment variables

2. **TypeScript Improvements**:
   - Fixed TypeScript errors related to OAuth implementation
   - Added proper type annotations for Google OAuth2Client
   - Replaced protected method calls with public API alternatives
   - Ensured compatibility with google-auth-library version

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Updated environment variables to support OAuth configuration
   - Added support for configurable OAuth callback port
   - Implemented extraction of port information from redirect URI

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added OAuth setup instructions to README
   - Created privacy policy template for Google API compliance
   - Updated memory bank files to reflect OAuth implementation
   - Added new MCP tools documentation

5. **New MCP Tools**:
   - `getMyPlaylists`: Retrieves user's own playlists (including private)
   - `checkOAuthStatus`: Verifies OAuth authentication status

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps for the project include:

1. **Comment Functionality**: Implement tools for retrieving and analyzing comments:
   - Get top comments for videos
   - Analyze comment sentiment
   - Extract key topics from comments

2. **OAuth Scope Expansion**: Expand OAuth permissions to enable:
   - Adding/removing videos from playlists
   - Creating and managing playlists
   - Interacting with comments

3. **Code Refinements**: Implement improvements to existing code:
   - Enhanced error handling with more detailed error messages
   - Additional validation for edge cases
   - Performance optimizations for handling large result sets

4. **Testing Expansion**: Develop a more comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability across different scenarios:
   - Unit tests for new playlist functionality
   - Integration tests with YouTube API
   - Error handling tests

5. **Documentation Enhancements**: 
   - Add JSDoc comments to all new functions
   - Update inline documentation
   - Add examples for playlist usage

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Key decisions currently under consideration:

1. **OAuth Enhancement**: Deciding on additional OAuth features:
   - Additional scopes for write operations
   - Multi-user support for the OAuth implementation
   - Enhanced token management and security
   - Recovery mechanisms for authentication failures

2. **Caching Strategy**: Whether to implement a caching layer to reduce YouTube API quota usage and improve response times:
   - In-memory vs. persistent caching
   - Cache invalidation policies
   - Handling rate limiting with cached responses

3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhancing error responses with more context and potential recovery strategies:
   - More detailed YouTube API error handling
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation when partial data is available

4. **Additional Tool Expansion**: Identifying more YouTube API endpoints to expose as MCP tools:
   - Comment functionality
   - Advanced analytics
   - Subscription management

5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring the server operates correctly across different operating systems and Node.js versions.

The project continues to be in a stable state with core functionality implemented and now enhanced with playlist management capabilities. The focus is now on further refinement, additional features, and improved user experience.
