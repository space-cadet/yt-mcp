# Active Context: YouTube MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The YouTube MCP Server is currently a functional implementation that provides access to YouTube data through a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface. The core functionality is complete, with all primary tools implemented and operational.

The current focus is on:

1. **Code Security Review**: We have completed a security review of the codebase to ensure there are no vulnerabilities or malicious code. The review confirmed the codebase is secure and follows best practices for handling API keys and external requests.

2. **Documentation**: Setting up comprehensive documentation in the memory-bank to establish a clear understanding of the project structure, technologies, and implementation patterns.

3. **Potential Enhancements**: Identifying opportunities for improving the current implementation with additional features, better error handling, or performance optimizations.

## Recent Changes

The most significant recent changes include:

1. **MCP Server Integration Fixes**: Fixed issues with Claude integration:
   - Created wrapper scripts (`start.sh` and `run-mcp.js`) for more reliable execution
   - Replaced `console.error()` with `process.stderr.write()` to ensure proper stream handling
   - Added alternative startup methods to bypass pnpm output interference
   - Updated package.json with new direct execution script options

2. **MCP Prompts Implementation**: Added support for the "prompts/list" MCP method:
   - Created a new prompts.ts file with example usage prompts
   - Configured the MCP server to handle the prompts/list method
   - Added 10 example prompts demonstrating different use cases for the YouTube MCP tools

3. **TypeScript Type Declarations Fix**: Resolved issues with TypeScript type declarations in the playlists.ts file:
   - Added `gaxios` package as a dependency to import the `GaxiosResponse` type
   - Fixed type declarations for YouTube API responses
   - Added explicit type annotations for callbacks in array methods
   - Fixed circular reference type errors

2. **Playlist Functionality Implementation**: Added comprehensive support for working with YouTube playlists, including:
   - Retrieving detailed playlist information
   - Getting videos contained in playlists
   - Searching for public playlists
   - Retrieving playlists from specific channels

3. **Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project scope and requirements
   - Created `productContext.md` to outline the problems solved and user experience goals
   - Created `systemPatterns.md` to document the architecture and design patterns
   - Created `techContext.md` to detail the technology stack and dependencies
   - Created this `activeContext.md` file to track current status and next steps
   - Updated `progress.md` to reflect the implementation of playlist functionality

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps for the project include:

1. **OAuth Authentication Implementation**: Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication flow to allow:
   - Access to a user's private playlists
   - Adding/removing videos from playlists
   - Creating and managing playlists

2. **Comment Functionality**: Implement tools for retrieving and analyzing comments:
   - Get top comments for videos
   - Analyze comment sentiment
   - Extract key topics from comments

3. **Code Refinements**: Implement improvements to existing code:
   - Enhanced error handling with more detailed error messages
   - Additional validation for edge cases
   - Performance optimizations for handling large result sets

4. **Testing Expansion**: Develop a more comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability across different scenarios:
   - Unit tests for new playlist functionality
   - Integration tests with YouTube API
   - Error handling tests

5. **Documentation Enhancements**: 
   - Add JSDoc comments to all new functions
   - Update inline documentation
   - Add examples for playlist usage

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Key decisions currently under consideration:

1. **Authentication Strategy**: Deciding on the best approach for implementing OAuth authentication:
   - Server-side vs. client-side flow
   - Token storage and refresh mechanisms
   - Security considerations for handling user credentials

2. **Caching Strategy**: Whether to implement a caching layer to reduce YouTube API quota usage and improve response times:
   - In-memory vs. persistent caching
   - Cache invalidation policies
   - Handling rate limiting with cached responses

3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhancing error responses with more context and potential recovery strategies:
   - More detailed YouTube API error handling
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation when partial data is available

4. **Additional Tool Expansion**: Identifying more YouTube API endpoints to expose as MCP tools:
   - Comment functionality
   - Advanced analytics
   - Subscription management

5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring the server operates correctly across different operating systems and Node.js versions.

The project continues to be in a stable state with core functionality implemented and now enhanced with playlist management capabilities. The focus is now on further refinement, additional features, and improved user experience.
