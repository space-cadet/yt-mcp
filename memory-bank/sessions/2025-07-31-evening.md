## Focus Task
T6: Desktop Extension Development
**Status**: ðŸ”„ **Priority**: HIGH
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T6: Desktop Extension Development
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Diagnosed Node.js runtime issue preventing extension from loading googleapis dependencies
- Identified Claude Desktop setting "Use Built-in Node.js for MCP" was disabled
- Researched DXT manifest command field options and Node.js runtime requirements
- Resolved runtime issue by enabling built-in Node.js (v22.15.1) instead of system Node.js (v16.0.0)
- Confirmed extension now loads dependencies successfully but crashes after initialization
**Status Change**: Debugging server initialization â†’ Server runtime resolved, initialization crash identified

## Files Modified
- `manifest.json` - Temporarily modified Node.js path (reverted after finding built-in solution)
- `.dxtignore` - Fixed dependency exclusions to preserve runtime dependencies while excluding dev dependencies

## Key Decisions Made
- Use Claude Desktop's built-in Node.js runtime instead of hardcoding system-specific paths
- Keep manifest command as "node" for maximum portability across user systems
- Focus on server initialization debugging as next priority

## Context for Next Session
Extension successfully uses built-in Node.js v22.15.1, loads all dependencies including googleapis, but server crashes immediately after receiving initialize message from Claude Desktop. Need to debug server initialization logic in dist/index.js.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Debug server initialization crash after successful dependency loading
2. Fix server exit logic to maintain connection with Claude Desktop
3. Test extension functionality with working server connection
