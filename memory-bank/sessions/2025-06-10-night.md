## Active Tasks
### T4: OAuth Deployment Accessibility
**Status:** ✅ **Priority:** MEDIUM
**Started:** 2025-06-10 **Completed**: 2025-06-10 13:45:00 IST
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Analyzed deployment accessibility issue for npx users
2. ✅ Implemented separate binary solution (yt-mcp-auth)
3. ✅ Enhanced OAuth error handling for graceful token management
4. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation overhaul
5. ✅ Tested end-to-end OAuth flow with local MCP server
6. ✅ Prepared package for v1.1.0 release

## Context and Working State
Successfully completed Task T4 - OAuth Deployment Accessibility. The core issue was that npx users couldn't access OAuth authentication since `npm run auth` scripts weren't available in npx deployments.

**Solution implemented**: Added separate `yt-mcp-auth` binary to package.json, allowing npx users to run `npx yt-mcp-auth auth` for OAuth authentication.

## Critical Files
- `package.json`: Added yt-mcp-auth binary entry and updated version to 1.1.0
- `src/utils/oauth.ts`: Enhanced error handling for token revocation
- `README.md`: Complete documentation overhaul with deployment instructions
- `.env.example`: Created environment variable template
- `memory-bank/`: Updated all task tracking files

## Session Notes
This session achieved a major milestone by solving the OAuth deployment accessibility issue. The solution provides a clean separation of concerns while maintaining ease of use for both npx and local development scenarios.

**Key achievements:**
- OAuth authentication now fully accessible to npx users
- Comprehensive documentation for all deployment scenarios
- Enhanced error handling for better user experience
- Project ready for v1.1.0 release with significant improvements

**Testing verification:**
- Local MCP server integration confirmed working
- OAuth authentication and private playlist access verified
- Both public and private YouTube API functionality tested successfully

**Next steps:**
- Commit changes and create v1.1.0 GitHub release
- Publish updated package to NPM
- Consider future enhancements for additional OAuth scopes
