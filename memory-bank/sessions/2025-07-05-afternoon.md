## Focus Task
T5: Fix Transcript Functionality Python Integration
**Status**: ✅ **Completed**
**Time Spent**: ~45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### T5: Fix Transcript Functionality Python Integration
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Analyzed Claude MCP server logs to identify Python subprocess failure with ModuleNotFoundError
- Discovered hardcoded 'python3' call in src/functions/videos.ts instead of using PYTHON_PATH env var
- Modified getTranscript method to use process.env.PYTHON_PATH || 'python3' for Python executable
- Rebuilt TypeScript and tested transcript functionality successfully
- Updated README.md with comprehensive Python setup documentation and troubleshooting
- Created task T5 documentation and updated memory bank files
**Status Change**: Created → ✅ Completed

## Files Modified
- `src/functions/videos.ts` - Modified getTranscript to use PYTHON_PATH environment variable
- `package.json` - Added youtube-transcript-plus dependency
- `README.md` - Added Python setup documentation and troubleshooting section
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Created and completed T5 task entry
- `memory-bank/edit_history.md` - Recorded all file changes for T5
- `src/types/youtube-captions-scraper.d.ts` - Deleted obsolete type definitions
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Created package manager lockfile
- `requirements.txt` - Created Python dependencies file
- `scripts/` - Created directory with Python transcript script
- `test-new-transcript.js` - Created test file for transcript validation
- `test_python_transcript.py` - Created Python test file

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented PYTHON_PATH environment variable support to allow custom Python executable paths
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to 'python3' if PYTHON_PATH not set
- Added comprehensive documentation to prevent future setup issues
- Included troubleshooting section for common transcript-related problems

## Context for Next Session
Transcript functionality is now fully operational. The YouTube MCP server properly respects PYTHON_PATH environment variable and documentation is comprehensive. No immediate follow-up work required for this issue.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Monitor for any additional transcript-related issues
2. Consider any other MCP functionality improvements if needed
3. Review overall project status and identify any remaining tasks
