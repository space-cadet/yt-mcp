## Focus Task
T6: Desktop Extension Development
**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T6: Desktop Extension Development
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Installed DXT CLI tools (@anthropic-ai/dxt v0.2.5) with pnpm global installation
- Resolved pnpm build script approval for @firebase/util, esbuild, protobufjs, re2 dependencies
- Initialized DXT structure using `dxt init` command with comprehensive configuration
- Created detailed manifest.json with all 15 YouTube MCP tools properly declared
- Fixed multiple manifest issues including corrupted author email, missing environment variable mapping
- Added complete tool listings with descriptions for searchVideos, getVideoDetails, getTranscripts, etc.
- Configured user_config for YouTube API key (sensitive) and transcript language with proper defaults
- Generated first .dxt package successfully but identified size optimization need (149.6MB package)
- Created desktop-extension-plan.md with comprehensive development strategy and optimization approach
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ In Progress

## Files Modified
- `manifest.json` - Created and fixed with comprehensive tool listings and environment mapping
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added T6 Desktop Extension Development task
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/desktop-extension-plan.md` - Created comprehensive development plan
- `memory-bank/sessions/2025-07-14-night.md` - Session documentation

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected Node.js server type for DXT extension to leverage existing codebase
- Configured proper environment variable injection for YOUTUBE_API_KEY and YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_LANG
- Identified package size optimization as critical next step (current 149.6MB needs reduction)
- Planned comprehensive .dxtignore strategy to exclude development dependencies
- Decided to maintain backwards compatibility with traditional MCP installation methods

## Context for Next Session
Package size optimization is the immediate priority. The 149.6MB package contains 46,973 files with 22,166 already ignored, indicating need for more aggressive dependency filtering. Focus should be on creating comprehensive .dxtignore file and analyzing production-only requirements to achieve target under 50MB.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Create comprehensive .dxtignore file to reduce package size significantly
2. Analyze dependency tree for production-only requirements and unnecessary Google API components
3. Test optimized package while ensuring all functionality remains intact
4. Design appropriate icon combining YouTube branding with data fetching symbols
5. Test .dxt installation process and document any issues discovered
