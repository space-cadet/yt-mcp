# Project Brief: YouTube MCP Server

## Project Overview
YouTube MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that leverages the YouTube Data API. The server allows AI language models to interact with YouTube content through a standardized interface, providing access to video information, transcripts, channel analysis, and trend data.

## Core Requirements

1. **YouTube Data Integration**: Implement a comprehensive interface to the YouTube Data API v3 that provides access to:
   - Video metadata and statistics
   - Video transcripts/captions
   - Channel information and statistics
   - Search and discovery functionality
   - Trending videos and analytics

2. **MCP Compatibility**: Create a fully compliant Model Context Protocol server that:
   - Follows the MCP specification
   - Provides well-defined tools with clear descriptions
   - Handles requests and responses appropriately
   - Manages errors gracefully

3. **API Key Management**: Ensure secure handling of YouTube API keys through:
   - Environment variables
   - Configuration files
   - No hardcoded credentials

4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient data retrieval strategies:
   - Pagination support for large result sets
   - Rate limiting awareness
   - Appropriate caching where beneficial

5. **Developer Experience**: Provide clear documentation and usage examples:
   - Installation instructions
   - Configuration guidance
   - Tool descriptions and parameters
   - Example queries and responses

## Project Constraints

1. **YouTube API Limitations**:
   - Respect YouTube API quota limits
   - Handle potential rate limiting
   - Work within the constraints of available API endpoints

2. **Security Requirements**:
   - Secure handling of API credentials
   - No exposure of sensitive information
   - Input validation for all external data

3. **Technical Dependencies**:
   - Node.js â‰¥ 18.0.0
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - MCP SDK for protocol compliance
   - Google APIs client libraries

## Success Criteria

The YouTube MCP Server will be considered successful when it:

1. Provides reliable access to YouTube data through a well-defined MCP interface
2. Handles errors gracefully and provides useful error messages
3. Is easily installable via standard package managers
4. Has clear documentation for setup and usage
5. Follows best practices for code quality, security, and performance
6. Is compatible with AI assistants that support the MCP specification
