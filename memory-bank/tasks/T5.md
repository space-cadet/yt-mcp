## Progress
1. ✅ Analyzed Claude MCP logs to identify Python subprocess failures
2. ✅ Discovered hardcoded 'python3' call instead of environment variable usage
3. ✅ Modified getTranscript method to use process.env.PYTHON_PATH || 'python3'
4. ✅ Rebuilt TypeScript to JavaScript and tested transcript functionality
5. ✅ Updated comprehensive documentation with Python setup requirements
6. ✅ Added troubleshooting section for transcript-related issues
7. ✅ Created and completed task documentation
8. ✅ Updated edit history with all file changes

## Context
The YouTube MCP transcript functionality was failing with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'youtube_transcript_api'" because the code was hardcoded to use 'python3' instead of respecting the PYTHON_PATH environment variable. The user had properly configured PYTHON_PATH to point to their conda Python installation which had the required package, but the code wasn't using it. Fixed by updating spawn call to use environment variable with fallback.
