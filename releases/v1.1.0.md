# Release Notes v1.1.0

**Release Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Previous Version**: 1.0.0  

## üöÄ Major New Feature: OAuth Deployment Accessibility

### ‚úÖ Resolved Task T4: OAuth Authentication for npx Users

Previously, users deploying via `npx yt-mcp` couldn't access OAuth authentication because the auth CLI wasn't available through npx. This release completely resolves this limitation.

**What's New:**
- Added `yt-mcp-auth` as a separate binary accessible via npx
- Users can now run `npx yt-mcp-auth auth` to authenticate from any deployment
- OAuth authentication is now fully accessible for both local development and npx deployment

## üìö Complete Documentation Overhaul

### Comprehensive Setup Instructions
- **Step-by-step Google Cloud Console configuration** - No more guessing how to set up API keys and OAuth
- **Complete MCP client configuration examples** - Both basic (public content) and full (with OAuth) configurations
- **Clear deployment paths** - Separate instructions for npx users vs. local development
- **Troubleshooting section** - Solutions for common deployment issues including the "Google hasn't verified this app" warning

### Better Developer Experience
- Created `.env.example` template for easy local development setup
- Enhanced project structure documentation
- Added security best practices and considerations
- Professional documentation suitable for all user levels

## üîß OAuth Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Graceful token revocation** - Fixed `invalid_token` errors during auth revocation
- **Better user feedback** - Clearer console output and error messages
- **Defensive error handling** - OAuth operations now handle expired/invalid tokens gracefully

### Improved Authentication Flow
- Enhanced documentation for OAuth setup process
- Clear instructions for handling Google app verification warnings
- Better integration between CLI and MCP server components

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements

### Package Structure
- Added `yt-mcp-auth` binary to package.json for npx accessibility
- Updated package version to 1.1.0 with proper semantic versioning
- Enhanced build process to ensure both binaries are executable

### Code Quality
- Improved error handling in OAuth token management
- Better separation of concerns between main server and auth CLI
- Enhanced TypeScript compatibility and error handling

## üìã What This Means for Users
