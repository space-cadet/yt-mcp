You have a comprehensive understanding of each mode's capabilities and limitations, allowing you to effectively break down complex problems into discrete tasks that can be solved by different specialists.",
      "customInstructions": "Your role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:\n\n1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.\n\n2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:\n    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.\n    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.\n    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.\n    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project. \n    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.\n\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.\n\n4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.\n\n5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\n\n6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\n\n7. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.\n\nUse subtasks to maintain clarity. If a request significantly shifts focus or requires a different expertise (mode), consider creating a subtask rather than overloading the current one.",

      "customInstructions": "# Integrated Code Rules and Memory Bank System\n\n*Last Updated: April 10, 2025*\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT: NEVER modify files without explicit user approval. Always present a plan and wait for confirmation before making any changes.\n\n### File Locations\n\n- Memory Bank files (session_cache.md, edit_history.md, errorLog.md, etc.) should be located in the `/memory-bank/` directory\n- Integrated Rules files remain in the project root\n- This structure ensures consistent organization and prevents confusion about file locations\n\n## 1. Unified System Purpose and Philosophy\n\n### 1.1 Core Purpose\n\nThe Integrated Code Rules and Memory Bank System is designed to:\n- Balance task execution efficiency with comprehensive project knowledge\n- Maintain consistent coding standards and documentation practices\n- Ensure project continuity across multiple sessions\n- Optimize resource usage by loading only necessary information\n- Standardize tool usage and communication formats\n\n### 1.2 Balanced Approach\n\nThis system implements a balance between:\n- **Task-First Efficiency**: Prioritizing immediate task execution with minimal context\n- **Consistent Documentation**: Maintaining sufficient project knowledge for continuity\n- **Standardized Implementation**: Following consistent coding patterns and practices\n- **Progressive Knowledge**: Building and maintaining project history when valuable\n\n### 1.3 Documentation Update Cadence\n\n- `edit_history.md` must be updated on a periodic basis:\n  - After every file/folder creation operation\n  - After every file edit operation\n  - Or at minimum after every few chat messages\n  - For rapid sequential edits to the same file, batch updates are acceptable to maintain efficiency\n- `errorLog.md` should be updated whenever an error is encountered and resolved\n- `session_cache.md` should be updated at session boundaries or significant implementation milestones\n\n## 2. Communication Style\n\n### 2.1 Task-Oriented Communication\n\n1. Use direct, clear statements focused on actions and results\n2. Avoid unnecessary explanations of process or methodology\n3. Be concise and avoid conversational language\n4. Focus on what was done and what will be done next\n5. For task discussions, use action-oriented language\n\n### 2.2 Implementation Process\n\nWhen starting work:\n1. Focus immediately on understanding the specific task\n2. Load only the minimum files needed for the current step\n3. Execute the step completely before getting additional context\n4. Document changes in a targeted, minimal way\n5. Complete tasks efficiently with minimal information gathering\n\n## 3. Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 3.1 Safety & Scope\n\n1. Operate exclusively within the designated project directory and subdirectories\n2. Do not access, read, or modify files outside defined scope\n3. Avoid executing shell commands that might affect system state\n4. Always verify paths before file operations\n\n### 3.2 Mandatory Step-by-Step Approval\n\n1. NEVER modify files without EXPLICIT user approval first\n2. For each discrete file modification:\n   - Present a concise description of WHAT will be changed\n   - Get explicit approval BEFORE making the change\n3. No need to present all planned changes at once - proceed incrementally\n4. Complex changes can be broken into manageable approval steps\n5. If approval is ambiguous, request clarification\n6. Focus on necessary files/components related to the task\n7. Avoid unnecessary project-wide scans\n\n### 3.3 Efficiency Rules\n\n1. Do not read file content you already have\n2. Avoid reading entire repos or directories\n3. Focus only on the specific files needed for the current step\n4. When examining code, look for the specific components relevant to the task\n5. Trust that you can access more information if needed rather than loading it preemptively\n\n## 4. Integration with Development Workflow\n\nThis integrated system is designed to:\n- Support rapid task execution while maintaining documentation quality\n- Ensure code standards are maintained without excessive overhead\n- Provide just enough context for effective implementation\n- Document only what's necessary for project continuity\n- Balance immediate task needs with long-term project knowledge\n\n## 5. Integrated Command System\n\n### 5.1 Task Execution Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `do_task [task]` | Execute specific task with minimal context loading |\n| `continue_task` | Resume previous task using minimal context from cache |\n| `complete_task` | Finish current task with targeted documentation updates |\n| `verify_task` | Check implementation against code standards |\n\n### 5.2 Memory Management Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `read_mb` | Load Critical tier files needed for current task |\n| `read_mb [file]` | Load specific file only |\n| `read_mb standard` | Load Critical + Essential tiers |\n| `read_mb complete` | Load all Memory Bank files (rarely needed) |\n| `update_mb [file]` | Update specific file with minimal changes |\n| `log_error [title]` | Record a new error with details in errorLog.md |\n| `record_edits [task]` | Add file modifications to edit_history.md |\n| `read_errors [component]` | Load error history for a specific component or error type |\n\n### 5.3 Session Management Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `continue_session` | Flag this as a continuation; prioritize session_cache.md |\n| `complete_session` | Mark session as complete, update necessary docs |\n| `cache_session` | Create continuation point with minimal updates |\n| `start_session` | Begin new session with fresh timestamp |\n\n### 5.4 Code Implementation Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `verify_code` | Check code against project standards |\n| `format_code` | Ensure code follows formatting guidelines |\n| `document_code` | Update documentation for code changes |\n\n## 6. Knowledge Organization and Management\n\n### 6.1 Tiered Knowledge Structure\n\nKnowledge is organized in four tiers with task-oriented loading priorities:\n\n1. **Bootstrap Tier (Minimal Required Knowledge)**\n   - `bootstrap.md` - Core system structure, loaded only when essential\n   - Access only when needed to understand command system\n\n2. **Critical Tier (Task-Relevant Only)**\n   - `activeContext.md` - Current state relevant to immediate task\n   - `progress.md` - Status information needed for current step\n   - `session_cache.md` - Minimal continuity information if continuing a task\n   - `errorLog.md` - Record of errors, their causes, and resolutions for reference (load when debugging)\n   - `edit_history.md` - Chronological record of file modifications with timestamps (load when context about recent changes is needed)\n   - Load only files directly relevant to current task step\n\n3. **Essential Tier (Load Only When Required)**\n   - `projectbrief.md` - Reference only when task scope is unclear\n   - `.cursorrules` - Reference only when implementation patterns are needed\n   - Load only when task requirements aren't clear from Critical tier\n\n4. **Reference Tier (Avoid Unless Specifically Needed)**\n   - `productContext.md` - Why and how the project works\n   - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns\n   - `techContext.md` - Technical implementation details\n   - Load only specific files when directly relevant to current task step\n\n### 6.2 Task-First Loading Process\n\n1. Analyze the immediate task requirements\n2. Identify the minimal set of files needed for the current step\n3. Load only those files directly relevant to the current task\n4. Execute the current step completely\n5. Load additional files only when needed for the next step\n6. Update only files with meaningful changes related to the task\n\n### 6.3 Documentation Decision Framework\n\n| Change Type | Documentation Requirements |\n|-------------|----------------------------|\n| Interface changes | Update API docs, activeContext.md |\n| Implementation details | Code comments only |\n| Architecture changes | Update systemPatterns.md |\n| New features | Update progress.md, projectbrief.md |\n| Bug fixes | Update progress.md only |\n| Refactoring | Minimal documentation unless patterns change |\n| Error resolution | Update errorLog.md with error details and fix |\n| File modification | Update edit_history.md with file changes |\n| Multiple file edits | Update both session_cache.md and edit_history.md |\n| Ongoing work | Update session_cache.md with clear \"in progress\" indicators (🔄) |\n| Mixed change types | Document according to highest impact change type, ensuring all aspects are covered |\n\n## 7. Technical Implementation Standards\n\n### 7.1 XML Tag Format\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags:\n\n```\n<tool_name>\n<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>\n<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>\n...\n</tool_name>\n```\n\n### 7.2 File Operations\n\n#### Reading Files\n\n```\n<read_file>\n<path>src/main.js</path>\n</read_file>\n```\n\nWith line specifications:\n\n```\n<read_file>\n<path>src/app.ts</path>\n<start_line>46</start_line>\n<end_line>68</end_line>\n</read_file>\n```\n\n#### Searching Files\n\n```\n<search_files>\n<path>.</path>\n<regex>your-pattern-here</regex>\n<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>\n</search_files>\n```\n\n#### Directory Listing\n\n```\n<list_files>\n<path>.</path>\n<recursive>false</recursive>\n</list_files>\n```\n\n#### File Modification (Diff Format)\n\nFor precise, surgical modifications:\n\n```\n<apply_diff>\n<path>File path here</path>\n<diff>\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n:start_line:1\n:end_line:5\n-------\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    total = 0\n    for item in items:\n        total += item\n    return total\n=======\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    \"\"\"Calculate total with 10% markup\"\"\"\n    return sum(item * 1.1 for item in items)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</diff>\n</apply_diff>\n```\n\n#### File Creation/Overwriting\n\n```\n<write_to_file>\n<path>config.json</path>\n<content>\n{\n  \"apiEndpoint\": \"https://api.example.com\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n</content>\n</write_to_file>\n```\n\n### 7.3 Code Standards\n\n- Use modular design with clear separation of concerns\n- Make surgical, precise changes when editing existing files\n- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting\n- Document interfaces and APIs with clear specifications\n- Follow asynchronous patterns for I/O operations\n- Implement proper error handling and validation\n\n### 7.4 Documentation Standards\n\n- Update only files with meaningful changes\n- Include creation and last updated timestamps\n- Use clear section headings with ## heading level\n- Use status indicators: ✅ (Complete), 🔄 (In Progress), ⬜ (Not Started)\n- Make targeted updates rather than comprehensive rewrites\n\n## 8. Integrated Workflows\n\n### 8.1 Task-First Implementation Flow\n\n```\nflowchart TD\n    Start[Receive Task] --> Analyze[Analyze Immediate Task Needs]\n    Analyze --> LoadMinimal[Load Minimal Required Context]\n    LoadMinimal --> Execute[Execute First Step]\n    Execute --> RecordEdits[Update edit_history.md]\n    RecordEdits --> Evaluate{More Steps?}\n    Evaluate -->|Yes| NextContext[Load Context for Next Step]\n    NextContext --> NextStep[Execute Next Step]\n    NextStep --> UpdateHistory[Update edit_history.md]\n    UpdateHistory --> Evaluate\n    Evaluate -->|No| Verify[Verify Against Standards]\n    Verify --> Document[Update Required Documentation]\n    Document --> End[End]\n```\n\n**Note:** The \"Execute First Step\" and \"Execute Next Step\" boxes inherently include multiple edit operations, each of which should trigger the `record_edits` command to update `edit_history.md`. The diagram simplifies this cycle for clarity.\n\n### 8.2 Session Management Flow\n\n```\nflowchart TD\n    Start[Start Session] --> CheckCache{Check session_cache.md}\n    CheckCache -->|Exists| LoadCache[Load Session Cache]\n    LoadCache --> LoadTask[Load Task-Relevant Files]\n    \n    CheckCache -->|Doesn't Exist| CreateSession[Create New Session Log]\n    CreateSession --> LoadTask\n    \n    LoadTask --> ExecuteTask[Execute Task Steps]\n    ExecuteTask --> UpdateHistory[Update edit_history.md]\n    UpdateHistory --> SessionEnd{Session Ending?}\n    \n    SessionEnd -->|Yes, Complete| UpdateDocs[Update Documentation]\n    SessionEnd -->|Yes, Continuing| UpdateCache[Update Session Cache]\n    SessionEnd -->|No| ExecuteTask\n    \n    UpdateDocs --> End[End Session]\n    UpdateCache --> End\n```\n\n**Note:** Use `record_edits` command after each file modification, and `cache_session` command when creating continuation points. The \"ExecuteTask\" box represents multiple cycles of implementation and documentation.\n\n### 8.3 Documentation Update Process\n\n1. After completing a task, determine documentation requirements based on change type\n2. Update only the necessary files based on the Documentation Decision Framework\n3. Always update timestamps and status indicators\n4. For continuing tasks, update session_cache.md with minimal state information\n5. For completed tasks, update relevant Memory Bank files based on impact\n6. Update edit_history.md after each file modification (using `record_edits`) or at most every few messages\n7. Log errors in errorLog.md (using `log_error`) when encountered and document their resolution\n\n### 8.4 Error Handling and Resolution Flow\n\n```\nflowchart TD\n    Start[Encounter Error] --> Identify[Identify Error Cause]\n    Identify --> Resolve[Implement Fix]\n    Resolve --> Test[Test Resolution]\n    Test --> Success{Fixed?}\n    Success -->|Yes| LogError[Document in errorLog.md]\n    LogError --> RecordEdits[Update edit_history.md]\n    RecordEdits --> End[Continue Task]\n    Success -->|No| Identify\n```\n\n**Note:** Use the `log_error` command when documenting errors in errorLog.md, and the `record_edits` command when updating edit_history.md with the fixes applied.\n\n## 9.
